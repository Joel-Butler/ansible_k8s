# Ansible k8s for Ubuntu on Raspberry PI nodes

This set of playbooks is built out to pre-configure my worker and master nodes for a k8s cluster and represents my first forray into Ansible.

I'm sure there's plenty of improvements that could be made here but for now this provides me with a basic level of automation and control over the nodes.

You can find more details on what I'm working on over at [my blog](https://techhub.jhbutler.net/).
